ROCK PAPER SCISSORS 

In a world where rocks no longer exist, where children wonder what these "scissors" are that the ancestors speak of, where paper is a florp, one robot had one mission:  Conquer the world with a game of chance!  Through it's machine mind, a code was conceived and formulated.  This code was raw, expiremental, inefficient, and barely coherent, but it yeay it was good.  And on the world it unleashed a terrible curse: an endless cycle of chance, an unending war of simple stationary supplies and a rock.  Some say this battle rages still to this day, and that if you stand on the Cliffs of Shee-Cag_OHh, you can hear a dull thump, thump, thump, thwaap!
